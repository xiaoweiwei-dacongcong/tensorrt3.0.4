TensorRT 3.0 Python API Documentation
======================================================

TensorRT 3.0.0 includes support for Python, allowing developers to integrate a TensorRT
inference engine into a python development enviorment or to experiment with TensorRT
in an accessible fashion.

TensorRT 3.0.0 includes the Universial Framework Format (UFF), a way to convert 
models trained in Tensorflow and soon other framworks like Caffe2 to a single 
model format. TensorRT is also now able to generate engines from UFF models. 

Installing TensorRT and the UFF Toolkit
----------------------------------------

Workflows and Use Cases 
-------------------------
There are a couple use cases for which the Python API for TensorRT excels at. 

We have included a couple sample applications with the TensorRT Python package
which cover many of these use cases. 

1. There is an existing Tensorflow (or other UFF compatable framework) model that a developer wants to try out with TensorRT. 
   
   * `Convert Tensorflow to TensorRT <workflows/tf_to_tensorrt.html>`_  

2. There is a Caffe1 model that a developer want to try out with TensorRT
   
   * `Convert a Caffe Model to TensorRT <workflows/caffe_to_tensorrt.html>`_

3. A developer wants to deploy a TensorRT engine as a part of a larger application such as a web backend 
   

4. A developer wants to try out TensorRT with a model trained with a framework not currently supported by UFF and not trained by Caffe1.
   
   * `Manually Construct a TensorRT Engine <workflows/manually_construct_tensorrt_engine.html>`_
